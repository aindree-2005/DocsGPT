📜 Here's How to Contribute:

    🛠️ Code: This is the golden ticket! Make meaningful contributions through PRs.
    📚 Wiki: Improve our documentation, Create a guide or change existing documentation.
    🖥️ Design: Improve the UI/UX or design a new feature.

📝 Guidelines for Pull Requests:

Familiarize yourself with the current contributions and our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/arc53/projects/2).

Deciding to contribute with code? Here are some insights based on the area of your interest:

- Frontend (⚛️React, Vite):
    - Most of the code is located in [`/frontend`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/frontend) folder. You can also check out our React extension in [`/extensions/react-widget`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/extensions/react-widget).
    - For design references, here's the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OXLtrl1EAy885to6S69554/DocsGPT?node-id=0%3A1&t=hjWVuxRg9yi5YkJ9-1).
    - Ensure you adhere to the established guidelines.

- Backend (🐍Python):
    - Focus on [`/application`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/application) or [`/scripts`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/scripts). However, avoid the files [`ingest_rst.py`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/scripts/old/ingest_rst.py) and [`ingest_rst_sphinx.py`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/scripts/old/ingest_rst_sphinx.py), as they will soon be deprecated.
    - Newly added code should come with relevant unit tests (pytest).
    - Refer to the [`/tests`](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/tests) folder for test suites.
